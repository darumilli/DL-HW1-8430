# Homework-1 Deep Learning

The three tasks in this homework are in this directory and each sub task is in it's own sub-directory

1. Deep vs shallow
2. Optimimization
3. Generalization

### Deep vs Shallow

- Simulate a function
- Train on actual task(CNN/DNN models)
- Training results

### Optimization

- Visualize Optimizaton
- Observe gradient norm during training
- What happens when gradient is almost zero

### Generalization

- Can network fit random labels
- Number of parameters vs Generalization
- Flatness vs Generalization


Dataset used - MNIST(from pytotrch torchvision library)
Python version - 3.9
Environment: Jupyter Lab/Notebook

#### Packages used

- pytorch
- tensorflow
- numpy
- matplotlib
